# Hip-Hop Trivia

# Description
I created a Trivia Game front-end in React utilizing a classmates, Aarons, back-end(MongoDB, Express) and his created API. Aarons API contains Trivia questions based on the Hip-Hop music industry. 

This project is deployed on [Netlify](mern-front-end.netlify.app)

This link will lead you to the homepage. From there, click Trivia to play the game and keep track of your score. On the Trivia page, you can also update and delete questions. The last link is Create to add a new question. 

__Here lists the CRUD functionality:__
* CREATE: Creates a new trivia question
* DELETE: Will delete a trivia question
* UPDATE: Will update a trivia question if there is incorrect information!
