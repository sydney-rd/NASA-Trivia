# Astronomy Trivia ðŸ”­

## Description

Astronomy Trivia is a trivia game that utilizes my [NASA API project](https://sydney-rd.github.io/NASA-api-project/) which fetches data from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API (APOD). ðŸŒŒ

This project showcases 10 Astronomy-based trivia questions that I have sourced, along with an "Astronomy Picture of the Day" information card for each question.

Test your knowledge while admiring information and images sourced from NASA!
